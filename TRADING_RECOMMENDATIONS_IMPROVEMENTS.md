## 1. Enhanced Risk Management

### Step 1: Adjust Stop Loss and Target Price
- For strong buy signals (5+ confirmations):
  - Tighten stop loss to 0.8x ATR
  - Set target price to 2x entry price
- For moderate buy signals (3-4 confirmations):
  - Set stop loss to 1.1x ATR
  - Set target price to 1.3x entry price
- For weak buy signals (1-2 confirmations):
  - Set stop loss to 1.3x ATR
  - Set target price to 1.2x entry price

### Step 2: Adjust Risk Per Trade
- For strong buy signals: 1.5% risk per trade
- For moderate buy signals: 2% risk per trade
- For weak buy signals: 2.5% risk per trade

## 2. Enhanced Confirmation Criteria

### Entry Signal Confirmations:
1. RSI below 40
2. Stochastic RSI below 30
3. Williams %R above -20
4. CCI below -50
5. MACD histogram positive
6. ADX above 25
7. Uptrend detected
8. Above average volume
9. Price above 20-day MA
10. Price above 50-day MA
11. Price above 200-day MA
12. Price below lower Bollinger Band
13. Price above support level

## 3. Improved Buy Price Calculation

### Step 1: Optimal Buy Price Calculation
- Use 3% retracement level of the most recent swing high/low
- Validate against:
  - 20-day MA
  - 50-day MA
  - 200-day MA
  - Lower Bollinger Band
  - Recent swing lows

### Step 2: Entry Price Adjustment
- Use optimal buy price if it's below current price
- Otherwise, use current price

## 4. Additional Risk Management Parameters

### Step 1: Adjust Position Size
- Calculate based on adjusted stop loss and risk per trade
- Ensure position size is within account risk limits

### Step 2: Calculate Risk-Reward Ratio
- Use adjusted target price and stop loss
- Aim for minimum 1:1 ratio for weak signals
- Aim for 2:1 or higher ratio for strong signals

## 5. Reasoning and Metadata

- Provide clear reasoning for signal strength
- Include technical indicators used

### Step 2: Update Metadata
